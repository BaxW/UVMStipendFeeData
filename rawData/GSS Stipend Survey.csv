Housing prices are astronomical when compared to the rest of Vermont and neighboring states. I am barely breaking even and had to take out student loans to ease financial burdens. Furthermore, every year the comprehensive fee increases while the stipend remains the same. Which means every year graduate students take home less money due to increased fees and inflation.   

Additionally, the way that the 1098 is handled is different than my previous university. At both universities I was given a waiver for student health insurance but at UVM the cost of the covered health insurance is reported on my 1098. This makes it seem on my tax return that I received extra funding lowering my refund amount. 

In all I believe to make UVM attractive to graduate students and keep them happy the stipend needs to be increased to ~31,000."

Finances is an incredibly large source of stress for me and my fellow graduate students.

Much more feasible for couples to live together in a small apartment and split rent on a one-bedroom (which seems to skew the types of individuals who accept and join our program toward people who are in a long term relationship and are living with their partner), or to find a roommate for a small two bedroom and sacrifice independence. When looking at the current cost of living for a one-bedroom apartment and general cost of living, our stipends through UVM fall do short of average for our program (we have collected and documented this data for our specific program, compared to the programs where we most often lose students). Although the dollar amount may be similar or not so far off (our stipend is around $3,000 short of the average for comparable programs), this makes a significant difference for quality of life (in terms of cost of living for a Burlington apt). During interview/ recruitment weekends, this is always noticed and commented on by interviewees, who always ask about rent  and cost of living. Weâ€™re honest. Our recruitment numbers have suffered in recent years, with accepted applicants citing the mismatch between the stipend and cost of living as a reason for selecting another offer. As the graduate college seeks to increase enrollment in the coming years, this will certainly amplify these problems with the limited housing market in Burlington - and will presumably lead to more students having to live further from campus and commute via personal vehicles - increasing the need for parking on campus.  Iâ€™d love to be able to put more money toward savings - Iâ€™m only able to save minimally, and when I have an unexpected expense (surprise, the car needs new breaks) it quickly eats away at that safety net  that it takes me a while to build. I am aware that other individuals in my program are food insecure toward the end of the month, and many skip meals in order to make ends meet from time to time. "

We have to turn the heat down and wear our winter coats inside so that we can afford our bills.  Food is also expensive and lower quality (I get that we live far north, but there's no reason for milk to be as expensive as it is).

This also greatly impacts the coverage provided by my stipend. As a result, I have taken out student loans as a graduate student. While my loans from undergrad are currently deferred, I will ultimately have to pay off my undergraduate and graduate student loans once I graduate from UVM. Having a half-time stipend also limits the number of credits that are covered for me each semester, which does factor in to how much I am willing to pay for additional credits beyond this coverage each semester, especially given the fact I am paying for credits at the out of state rate. Overall, my comments would be that the stipend provided is not enough to live off of as a graduate student, unless there is another source of supplementary income, which is extremely difficult to do with the pressure and expectations as a grad student, or through other means such as tapping into my personal savings or taking out additional student loans."

The cost of rent in Burlington is almost as expensive as Boston for this reason. The current stipend is enough for those whom are homeowners outside of the burlington area. For students living in burlington, the current stipend is just barely enough for rent, food, basic necessities, the ~1k comprehensive fee a semester, and $150/month savings. Living in an apartment with rent $500-650 provides nothing but a run down old building that is poorly managed. It's almost dehumanizing to seek higher education for personal growth and then live in a run down apartment just to save money. There needs to be a way for graduate students to live and feel like successful people with the money we make. "

I have to buy groceries and cook three meals a day on top of my studies, which can be pretty exhausting. Other students who are better supported by their families seem to have money to go out for drinks, to restaurants, to order takeout, or even just to buy food on campus to avoid returning home to cook food. It is a little exhausting to have to wakeup early every day to cook breakfast and pack lunch at the same time, spending my Sundays doing food prep in order to have quick easy dinners for week days when I'm busy. It used to be that graduate students could occasionally go bowling on a weekend, or go on a hike, but my life is entirely absorbed by simply remaining healthy and on top of my studies. If I am ever to treat myself to a fun activity or tasty food, I later pay for it by not having enough time for work or enough money to eat healthy all month. It feels a little like hell. "
